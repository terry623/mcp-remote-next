# MCP-Remote-Next Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for `mcp-remote-next`, a proxy and client for connecting to remote MCP servers with OAuth support. The goal is to provide confidence that new PRs don't break core functionality while keeping the test infrastructure maintainable.

## Testing Challenges

- **Complex Environment**: CLI tool invoked by various MCP clients connecting to diverse MCP servers
- **OAuth Flows**: Browser-based authentication that's difficult to automate
- **Multi-instance Coordination**: Lockfile-based coordination between concurrent processes
- **Transport Diversity**: SSE, HTTP, and STDIO transports with fallback logic
- **Real-world Dependencies**: Testing requires both MCP clients and servers

## Client Selection

### Recommended: Simple Test Client with MCP SDK

**Build a minimal test client using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`** that:

- Spawns `mcp-remote-next` as a stdio subprocess (testing the real CLI)
- Connects via `StdioClientTransport` (how real MCP clients use it)
- Makes multiple requests in one session (tools/list, resources/list, prompts/list)
- Provides clean assertions on responses
- ~50 lines of TypeScript

This tests the **actual user flow**: spawning the proxy via CLI and communicating over stdio.

### Why Not Existing Tools?

- **client.ts**: Tests connecting _to_ remote servers, not _invoking_ mcp-remote-next as a CLI tool
- **MCP Inspector CLI**: Requires separate invocations per method (spawns process each time, unrealistic)
- **fast-agent**: Requires Go, real inference provider (Groq), and API keys - too complex

### Test Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Test Client    │  ← Simple Node.js script using MCP SDK
│  (stdio)        │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ stdio
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│  mcp-remote-next │  ← Spawned as: node dist/proxy.js <server-url>
│  (proxy.ts)     │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ SSE/HTTP
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│  Test MCP       │  ← Local server (Bun + @hono/mcp)
│  Server         │
└─────────────────┘
```

## Server Selection

### Phase 1: Public, Stateless, Authless Servers

To enable CI without secrets:

1. **Hugging Face MCP Server** (`@huggingface/mcp-server`)

   - Public, no auth required
   - Provides tools for model/dataset search
   - SSE transport
   - Can be run locally via `npx`

2. **Local Test Server** (custom)

   - Minimal Bun + `@hono/mcp` server
   - Controllable transport types (SSE-only, HTTP-only, both)
   - Controllable responses for error testing
   - No OAuth required for basic tests

3. **Cloudflare Workers MCP** (public endpoints)
   - Multiple demo servers available
   - HTTP transport
   - No auth for basic functionality

### Phase 2: OAuth Testing Servers

Once basic tests pass:

1. **OAuth Simulator** (custom, in-repo)

   - Minimal OAuth2 server for testing dynamic registration, token exchange, refresh
   - Controllable errors and timeouts
   - Runs locally in tests

2. **Example Server** (`https://example-server.modelcontextprotocol.io/`)
   - Real OAuth flow
   - Requires investigation of auth requirements
   - Good for manual/integration testing

### Phase 3: Advanced Scenarios

As needed for comprehensive coverage:

1. **Error Injection Server** (custom)
   - TLS errors (self-signed certs)
   - Connection failures, timeouts
   - Invalid responses

## Test Architecture

### Layer 1: Unit Tests

**Coverage**: Pure functions, utilities, parsing logic

```
test/unit/
├── utils.test.ts          # CLI parsing, header substitution, pattern matching
├── coordination.test.ts   # Lockfile logic (mocked filesystem)
├── oauth-client.test.ts   # Token storage, validation (mocked filesystem)
└── message-transforms.test.ts  # Ignored tools, clientInfo rewrite
```

**No external dependencies** - use mocks and stubs.

### Layer 2: Integration Tests

**Coverage**: Transport connections, OAuth flows, proxy behavior

```
test/integration/
├── transport.test.ts      # SSE/HTTP selection, fallback logic
├── oauth-flow.test.ts     # Auth flows with minimal OAuth simulator
├── proxy.test.ts          # Bidirectional message passing, filtering
└── multi-instance.test.ts # Coordination between concurrent processes
```

**Dependencies**: Local test servers (started/stopped by tests).

### Layer 3: E2E Smoke Tests

**Coverage**: Full client.ts and proxy.ts flows

```
test/e2e/
├── client-happy-path.test.ts  # Connect, list tools/resources
├── proxy-happy-path.test.ts   # STDIO bridge to remote server
└── error-scenarios.test.ts    # Common failure modes
```

**Dependencies**: Public MCP servers or local test servers.

## Test Scenarios (from Oracle Analysis)

### Priority 1: Core Connectivity

- [ ] **HTTP-first transport** connects to HTTP-only server
- [ ] **SSE-first transport** connects to SSE-only server
- [ ] **HTTP-first fallback** to SSE when HTTP unavailable
- [ ] **SSE-first fallback** to HTTP when SSE unavailable
- [ ] **Client mode** lists tools and resources successfully

## Test Server Specifications

### Minimal Test Server Requirements

For comprehensive testing, we need servers that can:

1. **Transport Variants**

   - SSE-only mode
   - HTTP-only mode
   - Both SSE and HTTP (for fallback testing)

2. **Auth Variants**

   - No auth
   - OAuth with dynamic registration
   - OAuth with static client info
   - Auth errors (401, invalid tokens)

3. **Response Control**

   - Fixed tools/resources lists
   - Error responses (500, schema violations)
   - Connection drops, timeouts
   - TLS errors (self-signed certs)

4. **Lifecycle**
   - Start/stop programmatically
   - Random port assignment
   - Clean shutdown

### Known Public Servers (for reference)

| Server         | Transport | Auth   | Tools                | Use Case                            |
| -------------- | --------- | ------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Hugging Face   | SSE       | None   | Model/dataset search | Phase 1 basic connectivity          |
| Cloudflare     | HTTP      | None   | Various              | Phase 1 HTTP transport              |
| Example Server | SSE       | OAuth? | Unknown              | Phase 2 OAuth (needs investigation) |

## Out of Scope (for now)

- Full agent integration testing (e.g., with fast-agent + real inference)
- Browser automation for OAuth flows (Playwright)
- Cross-platform OAuth coordination stress tests
- Real proxy server testing (--enable-proxy with Squid)
- Real TLS/VPN scenarios
- Performance/load testing

## Implemented

### Phase 1a: Public Server E2E Tests (✅ Complete)

- ✅ Test infrastructure with vitest in isolated test directory
- ✅ Test utilities for creating MCP clients and verifying connections
- ✅ Safe capability listing (tools/prompts/resources) with fallback handling
- ✅ E2E tests connecting to Hugging Face and Cloudflare public servers
- ✅ Build script integration (runs `pnpm build` before tests)
- ✅ Concise test syntax using utils.ts helpers

**Test Coverage:**

- Hugging Face MCP server connection
- Cloudflare MCP server connection
- Tool listing with graceful handling of unsupported capabilities

## Future Work

### Phase 1b: Local Test Server

1. Create minimal local test server

   - Bun + @hono/mcp or Node.js implementation
   - Controllable transport types (SSE-only, HTTP-only, both)
   - Fixed tools/resources/prompts lists
   - Start/stop programmatically
   - Random port assignment

2. Local server E2E tests
   - Test transport fallback logic (SSE → HTTP, HTTP → SSE)
   - Test proxy mode (STDIO bridge)
   - Test message filtering (ignored tools, clientInfo rewrite)

### Phase 2: GitHub Actions

1. Set up CI workflow
   - Run `pnpm build` and `pnpm test` in test directory
   - Execute on PRs and main branch
   - No secrets required (uses public servers)

### Phase 3: OAuth Testing

1. OAuth simulator implementation
2. OAuth flow tests (DCR, token exchange, refresh)
3. Multi-instance coordination tests

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Coverage

1. Unit tests (CLI parsing, utils, coordination)
2. Integration tests (transport, proxy, multi-instance)
3. Error injection and handling
4. Full test matrix from Oracle analysis

## Notes

- Keep Phase 1 simple: one passing test is better than ambitious plans
- Use existing `client.ts` as the test client - it's perfect for our needs
- Build test servers in-repo rather than depending on external infrastructure
- Add complexity gradually as tests prove valuable
- Prefer deterministic tests over flaky timing-dependent scenarios
